# Assignment 1 - Supervised Learning

This project analyses on the performance of five classification algorithms (Neural Network, SVM, k-NN, Decision Tree, and Boosting) tested on two distinct datasets (Bank Marketing and Credit Card Approval). The report contains individual analysis for the classification algorithms, followed the resulting prediction modelâ€™s performance comparison.
